PROCEDURE:
1. The trainer is switched and power supply is checked for +12V and -12Vwith the help
of multi meter.
2. The trainer is switched off and connections are made as per the patching diagram.
3. The LVDT is connected in the kit through connector provided in the circuit.
4. The displacement of LVDT is kept at one end by using screw guage.
5. The trainer is switched on and the output DC voltage is measured using multimeter by
connecting it across DC output + and – respectively.
6. The displacement is varied with the help of screw gauge and the corresponding output
voltages are noted down.
7. The screw gauge is adjusted for maximum displacement and then stopped.
8. A graph between displacement and output voltage is drawn.
